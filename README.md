The goal of metastat is to perform metabolomics data analysis.

## Objective

To improve understanding and facilitate interpretation, metastat
presents results through clear and informative data visualizations. It
allows easy integration and collaboration with other research teams by
exporting statistical tables to Excel spreadsheets. The tool ensures the
reliability and accuracy of data through a process of data cleaning and
quality assessment. It uses principal component analysis visualization
to gain insights and make informed decisions. It also provides the
ability to use univariate two-class statistics or multivariate analysis
using partial least squares discriminant analysis. The tool optimizes
the model and ensures the robustness of the results through permutation
testing and model prediction metrics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of metastat like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("danymukesha/metastat")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(metastat)
## basic example code
```
