The goal of `metastat` is to perform metabolomics data analysis.

## Objective

`metastat` presents results through clear and informative data
visualizations, to improve the understanding and facilitate the
interpretation of the results. It allows easy integration and
collaboration with other research teams by exporting statistical tables
to Excel spreadsheets. The tool ensures the reliability and accuracy of
data through a process of data cleaning and quality assessment. It uses
principal component analysis visualization to gain insights and make
informed decisions. It also provides the ability to use uni-variate
two-class statistics or multivariate analysis using partial least
squares discriminant analysis. Furthermore, the tool optimizes the model
and ensures the robustness of the results through permutation testing
and model prediction metrics.

## Installation

If you want to use the development version of `metastat`, run the
following command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("danymukesha/metastat")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(metastat)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'metastat'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     scale
## basic example code
```
